## Methodology

- **Excel**: Cleaned data, engineered features (Time Slot, Ride Outcome, etc.), and built a dynamic dashboard  
- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)**: Extracted KPIs and analyzed trends by hour, weekday, and pickup point  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: Conducted visual EDA to validate SQL findings  
- **PowerPoint**: Compiled business insights and recommendations
